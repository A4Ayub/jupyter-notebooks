    "I'm Rob DiPietro, a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/), where I'm advised by [Gregory D. Hager](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~hager/) and [Nassir Navab](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/nassir-navab/). My research focuses on machine-learning methods for modeling sequential data and on applications of those methods to health care. I also have fun teaching and trying to break concepts up into clear and concise pieces.\n",

    "I was previously an associate research-staff member at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](http://www.ll.mit.edu/) and a student at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/). My research at MIT LL and as an electrical-engineering masters student focused on detecting chemicals and materials in hyperspectral imagery. My research as a physics undergraduate student focused on characterizing collections of magnetic nanoparticles."

    "My research is centered around machine-learning methods for modeling sequential data, and I'm especially interested in recurrent neural networks and attention-based approaches. From an applications perspective, I focus on health care. For example, [operative skill is connected to postoperative complications](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1300625), and [current training practices need to improve](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19789010). Is it possible to automatically analyze trainee performance and automatically provide frequent, object feedback?"

    "- **Fall, 2015. Johns Hopkins University. Instructor, Machine Learning for Surgical Workflow Analysis.** In this course, students are exposed to basic machine-learning concepts and to some applications to surgical workflow analysis. About half of the course is taught thinking through problems using IPython notebooks.\n",
    "- **Spring, 2015. Johns Hopkins University. Teaching Assistant, Machine Learning: Data to Models.** In this course, students learn about probabilistic graphical models and various exact inference and approximate inference techniques.\n",
    "- **Spring, 2014. Johns Hopkins University. Co-Instructor, Intermediate Programming.** In this course, students learn how to design programs, how to write code that's efficient but simple, and how to debug code when it's not working (C and C++). For more information, see Prof. Yair Amir's [course page](http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/courses/cs120/).\n",
    "- **Intersession, 2014. Johns Hopkins University. Instructor, MATLAB for Data Analytics.** In this course, students with no prior programming experience learn to analyze and visualize data using MATLAB."

    "My research focuses on machine-learning methods for modeling sequential data, and I'm especially interested in recurrent neural networks. Is it possible to improve over LSTM and GRUs when it comes to capturing long-term dependencies? If so, can these approaches be carried over to very deep feed-forward networks? Is it possible to reduce RNN training times in a way that's principled?"
